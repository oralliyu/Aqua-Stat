Exploring Employee Salaries

library(DataComputing)
library(magrittr)
rm(list = ls())

```




```{r}


getwd()                          #Get working directory

rawUnitdy <-read.csv("Employee_Salaries_-_2017.csv")    #Read file in table format and create a data frame from it

gc(reset=TRUE)                 #Change from data frame to data table
tracemem(rawUnitdy)
EmployeeSalaries <- as.data.table(rawUnitdy)
gc()


```



```{r}

EmployeeSalaries   #Take a look

```


```{r}
#Clean EmployeeSalaries


EmployeeStats <-
  EmployeeSalaries %>%
  rename(name = Full.Name, gender = Gender, annualSalary = Current.Annual.Salary, grossPay = X2017.Gross.Pay.Received, overtimePay = X2017.Overtime.Pay, dept = Department, position = Employee.Position.Title, dateHired = Date.First.Hired, deptName = Department.Name, employeeStatus = Assignment.Category) %>%

## Plotting Year vs. Average Salary

```{r}

EmployeeStats %>%
  mutate(dateHired = mdy(dateHired)) %>%   #Correct variable type
  mutate(dateHired = year(dateHired)) %>%     #Change variable type to year
  mutate(year = dateHired) %>%              #rename variable
  group_by(year) %>%                   
  summarise(avgSlry = mean(annualSalary))       #average the salary per year
